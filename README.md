# Terminal version | How does it work?
Drag the app into the terminal or go into its directory 
type "CD_cmd -h" this should open up a help menu

# How to use it
Once the program is open you press the 'Create File' or run the 'CD_cmd -create' command for the cmd version 
after following the steps the program will create a CDIP.lock file which will allow you to connect to your computer without any input 

# How does it work?
The program searches on the port you selected for the file named CDIP.lock.
Once the program finds it, it will connect to the IP via the connection method choosen.

Every line of code written in this program was done by me!
I'm still a bit new to Python so don't expect the best code
