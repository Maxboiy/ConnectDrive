# ConnectDrive
ConnectDrive allows you to auto connect to another computer when you connect a flash drive

# Requirements
You don't need to have the following but it will be useful:
Remote Desktop Connection 
SSH
Another computer to connect with
Windows

# DISCLAIMER!
I would not recommend using this program for IP publicly available
instead use IP local to your own network

# Terminal version | How does it work?
Drag the app into the terminal or go into its directory 
type "CD_cmd -h" this should open up a help menu

# How to use it
Once the program is open you press the 'Create File'
you enter the prompts given and then the program will create a JSON file on the flash drive you chose

# How does it work?
The program searches on the port you selected for the file named CDIP.lock.
Once it finds it, it will connect to the IP via the connection method chosen.

Every line of code written in this program was done by me!
I'm still a bit new to Python so don't expect the best code
